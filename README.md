# Comet C2020 F3 NEOWISE

Don't miss Comet NEOWISE in the evening sky now. It won't be back for 6,800 years.

Here's where to look, according to NASA.

An amazing comet that thrilled early-morning stargazers earlier this month is now visible in the evening sky, and it's a sight you won't want to miss. After all, this comet won't be back for 6,800 years, NASA says. 

Comet NEOWISE can now be seen just after sunset for observers in the Northern Hemisphere, according to NASA. (Sorry, Southern Hemisphere skywatchers, it's not visible there.) The comet made its closest approach to the sun July 3 2020 but was only visible before dawn until mid-July.
